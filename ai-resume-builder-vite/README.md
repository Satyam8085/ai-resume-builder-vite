# AI Resume Builder (Vite + React)

This is a minimal, single-page Resume Builder built with React + Vite. It allows you to edit fields, add/remove experience & education items, preview the resume, and print/download using your browser's print dialog.

## Quick setup

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Notes & next steps (ideas)
- Add PDF export using `html2canvas` + `jsPDF` for better downloadable PDFs.
- Add templates and AI-generated summaries (connect to an AI API of your choice).
- Add user accounts and cloud save (Firebase, Supabase, etc.).
- Improve styling or add Tailwind if you prefer.

Enjoy!
